# VACuum Control Application for ALBA
# Usage:
#    vaccagui [CONFIG] ; tries to open config file with absolute path or relative to the vacca module.
#
# With no argument the file default.py or TANGO_HOST.py will be launched as config
#
# The VACCA_PATH environment variable should be used to set the path to vacca modules
# To use vacca widgets in other GUI's, both vacca and vaccagui modules must be in PYTHONPATH

# NOTE: It's better to not modify this file to allow setup.py to work properly, 
# to write your custom launcher better copy it to vaccagui.sh and continue editing there.

#Source your own environment variables from here:
#source alba_blissrc
